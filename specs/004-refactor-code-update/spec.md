# Feature Specification: Repository-wide Codebase Refactor

**Feature Branch**: `004-refactor-code-update`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "给我整体重构一下项目，特性分支名为：refactor_code_update，重点关注以下几点：\n- 确保重构过程中保障业务逻辑正确，不要破坏现有的业务逻辑\n- 确保数据源统一，同一份数据源（比如const、function、Class等）不要在不同文件中重复声明\n- 保持代码清爽，不要残留无用的代码\n- 不需要考虑向后兼容，如果认为代码编写不合理，可以产生破坏性重构，但是要保障业务逻辑"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Inventory current installer workflows and record expected behaviors per module
   → Capture activation outcomes for onboarding, environment setup, CLI install, account linking
2. Identify duplicated or divergent data sources across processes
   → Classify declarations by ownership domain (shared, renderer-only, main-process-only)
3. Define target structure that consolidates shared data and removes obsolete modules
   → Flag conflicting patterns that require product sign-off
4. Plan phased refactor passes preserving business logic after each pass
   → Validate via regression suites and manual smoke checks
5. Decommission superfluous assets and legacy entry points once parity is confirmed
   → Document removals and migration notes for stakeholders
6. Secure approval that all critical flows behave identically to the captured baseline
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Keep installer user journeys unchanged while reorganizing code modules.
- ✅ Centralize authoritative data definitions and surface owners for future updates.
- ❌ Do not postpone cleanup; remove legacy files and dead pathways within the branch.
- 👥 Communicate breaking structural shifts to release, QA, and support leads before merge.

### Section Requirements
- Complete every section below with user-visible impacts of the refactor.
- Remove or merge subsections that no longer apply after consolidation decisions.
- Anchor all statements in observable behaviors or stakeholder needs.

### For AI Generation
1. Enumerate uncertainties that require product or engineering confirmation before implementation.
2. Avoid recommending specific code patterns; describe desired outcomes instead.
3. Treat data ownership, fallback behaviors, and post-refactor validation as primary clarification topics.
4. Highlight risks around privilege escalation, environment detection, and download mirrors if touched by the refactor.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: 在重构后，所有需要跨进程复用的常量 / 配置应统一放在哪个位置？ → A: 选项 A，放在现有的 `src/shared` 目录并按功能归类。

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Operations and support teams need the installer to retain all existing capabilities after the structural refactor so that end users can complete setup without noticing any behavioral changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the latest refactored build, **When** a first-time user follows the full installation wizard, **Then** the flow completes with identical steps, prompts, and success criteria compared to the baseline build documented before the refactor.
2. **Given** the refactored codebase, **When** engineering inspects shared configuration values, **Then** each value has a single authoritative declaration that is reused wherever needed with no duplicated constants.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a module previously relied on implicit defaults that are removed during cleanup?
- How does system handle features that span multiple processes (main, preload, renderer) when their data contracts are consolidated?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve current installer workflows, prompts, and success outcomes for onboarding, environment preparation, CLI installation, and account linkage.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a single authoritative declaration for every shared constant, configuration object, and reusable helper currently duplicated across files, centralized within the existing `src/shared` directory and grouped by function.
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove legacy modules, assets, and code paths that are no longer referenced after the consolidation while ensuring no runtime references remain.
- **FR-004**: System MUST document and communicate any intentional breaking structural changes so downstream teams can adapt build, packaging, or support materials before release.
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate parity with the pre-refactor baseline using the automated test suite and agreed manual smoke scenarios before the branch is marked ready for merge.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Shared Configuration Catalog**: Represents consolidated environment variables, installer steps metadata, and URLs that must have a single point of truth accessible across processes.
- **Installer Workflow Map**: Captures the ordered steps, decision points, and user-facing copy that define successful completion criteria for onboarding and setup journeys.
